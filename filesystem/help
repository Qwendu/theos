Welcome.

To see a list of files and folders in the root directory, type

    list_directory ""

You can then also run list_directory with any of the entries marked "dir" as an argument to see
the files that are stored in subfolders. For example

    list_directory "programs"

will show you a list of programs you can run. Command line arguments are declared in the executable
header, and are type-checked, so if you get them wrong the shell can let you know.

If some info that you still wanted to look at is now starting to be scrolled off the top of the
screen, you can hold left-control and press the up-arrow to scroll back up.
