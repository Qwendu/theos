One fun thing you can do is see the commands that have resulted in the screen looking the way it
did when you first booted.

    read "system/startup"

You can also assemble and run some fun programs.

    read "code/welcome.asm"
    assemble "code/welcome.asm", "welcome"
    inspect_exe "programs/welcome"
    welcome

This will take the assembly code in "code/welcome.asm" and assemble it into a program called
"welcome", which will be stored in "programs", with the other programs. You can then run it like
normal, or inspect it with the inspect_exe program.

Also try

    view_image "pictures/florence.ppm"

To add your own pictures to the pictures folder from the host operating system, put them in
"theos/filesystem/pictures", and run "jai-linux first.jai - no_kernel".

To do a challenging chess puzzle, type

    list_directory "chess_files/puzzles"
    read "chess_files/puzzles/morphy_isouard_1858" | chess HUMAN, CEIJ, 10
