The output of many programs looks like a table. This is not textual information, but rather well
structured data that programs can parse out easily. Try

    tasks | equals state, AWAKE

This just runs a command, and then passes the output table to a userspace application, which can
compare the names of the fields to their values, and filter the table. Another example is

    list_directory "" | equals type, folder
