The output of many programs looks like a table. This is not textual information, but rather well
structured data that programs can parse out easily. Try

    tasks | equals state, AWAKE

This just runs a command, and then passes the output table to a userspace application, which can
compare the names of the fields to their values, and filter the table. Another example is

    list_directory "" | equals type, folder

Composing commands on the command line is normally an inexpressive way to control a computer.
The binary data format helps a little, but in the future we will also do many fun things with
visual representation and mutation of this data.

Input and output of data from a process, from the perspective of user code, can be implemented
very transparently by the operating system API, if your programming language of choice supports
type introspection.
